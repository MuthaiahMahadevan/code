Given a number in its binary form find if the given binary number is a multiple of 3. It is recommended to finish the task using one traversal of input binary number.
Example 1:

Input: S = "0011"
Output: 1
Explanation: "0011" is 3, which is divisible by 3.
Example 2:

Input: S = "100"
Output: 0
Explanation: "100"'s decimal equivalent is 4, which is not divisible by 3.

class Solution {
    int isDivisible(String s) {
        int n=Integer.parseInt(s);
        int i=0;
        double ans=0;
        int a = 2;
        while(n>0){
            int r = n%10;
            double pow = (Math.pow(a,i));
            ans = (r * pow) + ans;
            n = n/10;
            i++;
        }
        // System.out.print(ans);
        if(ans % 3 == 0)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        else
            return 0;
    }
}
